The increasing popularity of underwater photography and marine life observation, along with the rise of digital media promoting exotic diving destinations, plays a significant role in attracting new divers. Moreover, the post-pandemic recovery period has seen a resurgence in international travel, contributing to a rise in tourism-based activities, including scuba diving.
